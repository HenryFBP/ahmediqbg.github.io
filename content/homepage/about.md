## Self Introduction

<i><small>This site.</small></i>

I'm a Senior at Harding University, and used to work as a private tutor for C++, JavaScript, and varouis math levels ranging from calculus to differential equation .

In my free time I like to bake, go cycling, play video games, and scuba dive (if I have enough time).

Check out <u>[my GitHub](https://github.com/HenryFBP/)</u> for code that I make, and message me if you'd like to get tutored on something or have any questions.
