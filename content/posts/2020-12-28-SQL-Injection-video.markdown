A video I made about SQL Injection. Took about 5 hours total. I don't do video editing or stuff like this frequently, but thought I'd post it here. Enjoy!

I used:

- OpenShot (It is genuinely painful to use for keyframes or splicing/positioning, please use DaVinci Resolve or kdenlive instead)
- Audacity
- GIMP
- Visual Studio Code

I want to say thanks to the original repository creators, AppSecCo, for putting this source code on GitHub. Their GitHub page is below.
