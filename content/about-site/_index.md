## Q: Cool site. Can I have one like this?

A: Yes!


Clone [this repo](http://github.com/ahmediqbg/ahmediqbg.github.io) and just edit it and reupload it to GitHub!

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ahmediqbg/ahmediqbg.github.io
    git remote set-url origin https://your.remote.here.tld/

Alternatively, you can [fork it](https://github.com/ahmediqbg/ahmediqbg.github.io/fork).

See [this link](https://www.wangchucheng.com/en/docs/hugo-eureka/getting-started/) and [this intro link](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) for more info.

## Q: Nice favicon. Where's it from?

A: Thanks! My good friend [@flexadecimal](https://github.com/flexadecimal/) made it. He is a very talented C programmer. Go give him free coffee and car parts.
